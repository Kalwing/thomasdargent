    "|Building things out of spite|\n",
    "\n",
    "The other day, I updated my computer (From Ubuntu 20.04 !!!), and I immediately found myself in a rabbit hole of personalization,\n",
    "After tweaking my Vim and ohmyZsh profiles (themes and plugin) for hours (It took me a looong time to get them *just right*),\n",
    "using my terminal now felt like using a beautiful, well lubricated, machine. Now that my terminal was looking good, I thought about adding something extra...\n",
    "\n",
    "I always loved the concept of the \"quote of the day\". When I was in high school, there was an option \n",
    "to display Dilbert comics on the homepage. I didn't really like them, but having this little \"advent calendar\"\n",
    "every day was nice. So when I set up my zsh, I  used a quote plugin to display a new quote at each terminal opening !\n",
    "And it worked, and it was great.\n",
    "\n",
    "I then noticed that most quotes were... very American. Pardon my French point of view,\n",
    "but the editorial line was very personal development oriented. Very individualistic.\n",
    "Most of all, there were some people I didn't like. So when, sipping my morning coffee, I landed on a quote by Bill Cosby...\n",
    "I snapped. I had to save my little quote machine. Here I will present this little project of mine, \n",
    "nothing technical, but hey, I said I was gonna blog.\n",

    "## Building an API \n",
    "\n",
    "First I had to build a small API to get my quotes. Why not fetch the data locally ? \n",
    "Well, I would like to be able to use my dotfiles on servers via ssh. Then the question is how the data has to be stored.\n",
    "Here's my specifications, I need to:\n",
    "Have a list of element that have:\n",
    "\n",
    "* A list of author/dialogue line pairs, so that I can display dialogues\n",
    "* A tag to define the category of the quote (basic/movie/lyric...)\n",
    "\n",
    "I wanted the API to run on my existent flask infrastructure for my website. \n",
    "I saw two options, a database with two table (quote and quote handler) or a simple file.\n",
    "Having a database just for this small project and to hold very few quotes seemed a bit much. Here's the mighty JSON structure I chose, just enough to store a few lines:\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "[\n",
    "\t{\n",
    "\t\t\"lines\": [\n",
    "\t\t\t{\n",
    "\t\t\t\t\"author\": \"Donald Knuth\",\n",
    "\t\t\t\t\"quote\": \"To program is to write to another programmer about our solutions to a problem\"\n",
    "\t\t\t},\n",
    "            {\n",
    "\t\t\t\t\"author\": \"Dlanod Knuth\",\n",
    "\t\t\t\t\"quote\": \"To program is to write to another programmer about anything but a solution\"\n",
    "\t\t\t}\n",
    "\t\t],\n",
    "\t\t\"tag\": \"dev\"\n",
    "\t},\n",
    "    ...\n",
    "]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "As that was settled, I had to fill the \"database\". After collecting a few quotes I liked, I built a simple API with Flask.\n",
    "```{.python filename=\"routes_api.py\"}\n",
    "@bp.route(\"/get_quote\", methods=[\"GET\"])\n",
    "@bp.route(\"/get_quote/<tag>\", methods=[\"GET\"])\n",
    "def quote_giver(tag: str=None):\n",
    "    _json = pick_quote(tag=tag)\n",
    "    if _json is None:\n",
    "        return \"Wrong tag\", 404\n",
    "    response = jsonify(_json)\n",
    "    return response\n",
    "```\n",
    "Using a JSON file meant that I couldn't select according to the tag easily, so I made a script that made another one split by tags:\n",
    "```JSON\n",
    "{\n",
    "    \"tag0\" : [ {\"lines\" : [...]}, {\"lines\" : [...]}, ... ],\n",
    "    \"tag1\" : [ {\"lines\" : [...]}, {\"lines\" : [...]}, ... ],\n",
    "    \"tag3\" : [ {\"lines\" : [...]}, {\"lines\" : [...]}, ... ],\n",
    "    ...\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "Now I could make function to pick the quote accordingly.\n",
    "```{.python filename=\"routes_api.py\"}\n",
    "def pick_quote(tag=None):\n",
    "    if tag is None:\n",
    "        path = Path(current_app.static_folder)/'data/quotes.json' \n",
    "        with open(path, 'r') as file:\n",
    "            return random.choice(json.loads(file.read()))\n",
    "    else:\n",
    "        path = Path(current_app.static_folder)/'data/quotes_sorted.json'  \n",
    "        with open(path, 'r') as file:\n",
    "            quotes = json.loads(file.read())\n",
    "            try:\n",
    "                return random.choice(quotes[tag])\n",
    "            except KeyError as e:  # incorrect tag\n",
    "                return None\n",

    "\n",
    "I couldn't help myself. I was there, fetching quotes in my browser, and I thought: hey, what if I built a web page to display them ? So, having no self-control, I did.\n",
    "I built a small webpage that fetched quotes dynamically using a touch of HTMX (but again, I didn't want to add too much stuff in my flask files, so I did most of the JSON object -> HTML conversion in the webpage).\n",
    "\n",
    "It worked fine, except that when I reloaded twice, nothing happened. Well in dev mode there was no issue, everything worked fine. Without dev mode, nothing happened. I was puzzled for quite sometime before I figured that the request was indeed sent, but the browser cached the answer the first time... Makes sense. So I added some lines to my Flask API:\n",
    "\n",
    "```{.python filename=\"routes_api.py\"}\n",
    "@bp.route(\"/get_quote\", methods=[\"GET\"])\n",
    "@bp.route(\"/get_quote/<tag>\", methods=[\"GET\"])\n",
    "def quote_giver(tag: str=None):\n",
    "    _json = pick_quote(tag=tag)\n",
    "    if _json is None:\n",
    "        return \"Wrong tag\", 404\n",
    "    response = jsonify(_json)\n",
    "    response.headers['Cache-Control'] = 'no-cache, no-store, must-revalidate'\n",
    "    response.headers['Pragma'] = 'no-cache'\n",
    "    response.headers['Expires'] = '0'\n",
    "    return response\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that was perfect. You can see it live [here](https://thomasdargent.com/api/wisdom). Great stuff. Now I could finally get back to my termin...\n",

    "Ok. Please don't yell at me. I was collecting some more quote and noticed that I had a LOT of quote from Mass Effect.\n",
    "Yes, it's my favorite game, I would die for Jack and Cortez, sue me.\n",
    "So I also built a webpage for those special quotes, with some random event and everything... You can see it [here](https://thomasdargent.com/mass_effect_quote).\n",
    "\n",
    "Time to get back to the terminal.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Back on track: the mighty terminal\n",
    "\n",
    "There. So I just had to figure a way to get from the API to the terminal. It's been a long time since I did anything \"new\" in shell.\n",
    "I knew I would use curl to get the JSON object, but after that... I discovered jq which is really well documented, and I ended with this (more or less) one-liner:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "fetch_kwote () {\n",
    "    if [[ $# < 1 ]]; then\n",
    "        echo \"Usage fetch_kwote API_url [timeout]\"\n",
    "        exit 1\n",
    "    fi\n",
    "    if [[ $# -eq 2 ]]; then\n",
    "        timeout=$2\n",
    "    else\n",
    "        timeout=5\n",
    "    fi\n",
    "    curl --connect-timeout $timeout --silent $1 | jq '[.lines.[] | .author, .quote]' | display_kwote || exit 1\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "Here I get the JSON from the address given as the first parameter, in silent (the goal is to display just the quote, not curl infos !), and with a defined timeout\n",
    "(I need to connect quickly). The result is piped to jq. Jq get the `lines` key, \n",
    "iterate over the array piping each to extract `author` and `quote`. The result is \n",
    "a series of string alternating between author and quote. Which I then feed to `display_kwote` my display function. I won't put it here as it is useless, it collects author and quote alternatively, and display them with different colors.\n",
    "\n",
    "And that’s it! With the magic of curl, jq, and a touch of spite, my terminal now gives me the quote I want, the quotes I NEED.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](img/quote_term.png?width=700){fig-alt=\"Screenshot of my terminal displaying a quote from Tolkien\"}\n",
    "\n",
    "### Birthdays and Dr. Manhattan\n",
    "\n",
    "One thing I realized is that I wanted to display some quotes on special days. For example, on my birthday, I want my terminal to sing.\n",
    "Or on the 10th of November, telling us that Dr. Manhattan is starting to come back to life... \n",
    "That means I had to add three things:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. A way to define the correct date range for a quote in the JSON file\n",
    "2. A way to fetching quote with a higher probability for quotes corresponding to the date given\n",
    "3. A way to avoid displaying those quote when they're outside their defined interval.\n",
    "\n",
    "For 1. I added a \"date\" field to some object of the form `weekday day/month/year`, \n",
    "with an `*` when the element is not defined. Which for my birthday would give `* 18/01/*` (remember it !).\n",
    "I also set their tag to `date` but that might change, I'll think about it !\n",
    "\n",
    "For 2. I added a probability to display a date object, and otherwise display any object (not dated)\n",
    "\n",
    "For 3. a simple `avoid` get list parameter.\n",
    "I can now make sure I never miss those two national holidays.\n",

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "What I love with those kinds of easy projects is that they keep you happy for a long time. You feel gratification at first, but then, as you keep using the tool, building around it, as it settles into dust, you forget how it was made. You forget about its existence and then eventually you rediscover it, and it brings you joy again. And there's no surprise that a little spite is what would fuel a project I’d actually use every day.\n",
