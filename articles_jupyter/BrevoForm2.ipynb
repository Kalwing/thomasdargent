    "# A simpler newsletter form : Building the form with HTMX\n",
    "|How to show API results nicely and dynamically|\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "### Context\n",
    "In the last tutorial we made a view to create contacts in a Brevo list. I will now show you how to integrate it with a webpage using HTMX. HTMX can be seen as a replacement to JQuery that is written in your HTML code. Despite being simple, it's very powerful and can do a lot of things. I used it for a project and I fell in love like never before (sorry to my ex-partners). We will use it to send our post request to the view we created last time, and affect the DOM according to the results. I'm new to it so there might be things that could be done in a more idiomatic way.\n",
    "\n",
    "The other nice framework I will use is TailwindCSS. In the same manner, it allows us to style elements directly in HTML. I've found it to be a much faster way to prototype, and a nice way to remember the attributes of an element. I will not explain everything except some patterns, but encourage you to check it out.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Plan\n",
    "First, a quick Tailwind tour, showing off some small useful patterns.. Then, we'll get to HTMX to display a success icon if the contact was created. Finally, we will display the errors in the form, because the user need to know they messed up."

    "## Making the form\n",
    "I won't go into many details as there is nothing really special here, just your average form doing an honest job. The HTML is pretty basic : make a form that contains labels linked to inputs, and a submit button. The inputs are mostly of type `text`. Don't forget to set the mail one to `email`, you know, it's nicer. I put my label+input into a div to style them together. Nothing more to say.\n",
    "\n",
    "Tailwind allow us to easily make a responsive form that looks nice. To do that, you add special class that are then parsed and added to your stylesheet by Tailwind. For example, `bg-gray-100` will be interpreted as :\n",
    "```css\n",
    ".bg-gray-100 {\n",
    "    --tw-bg-opacity: 1;\n",
    "    background-color: rgb(247 246 243 / var(--tw-bg-opacity));\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "With `gray-100` corresponding to a color in a `gray` palette I defined. `w-full` means that the `width` take a value of `100%`. Of course, I won't explain everything here (even if reading the documentation together could be fun) but you can see how it's way shorter than writing plain css.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Demo\n",
    "You can resize the width of the box to simulate responsiveness, and see my beautiful js in action.\n",
    "```{=html}\n",
    "<div class=\"demo-container\">\n",
    "    <iframe id=\"demo0\" class=\"demo\" src=\"https://thomasdargent.com/f/brevo_form_example\">\n",
    "    </iframe>\n",
    "    <div class=\"resizer\"></div>\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "```\n",
    "### Nice to know\n",
    "#### Responsiveness\n",
    "The demo size on my website is very small (it's a blog post, not designed to fill a full HD screen)  so I had to tweak a few things to make sure it plays nice. Those wouldn't be a problem normally (but might be of interest to you, especially if you want to copy the code):\n",
    "\n",
    "First, I defined two new breakpoints, `xxsm` and `xsm` :\n",
    "```js\n",
    "module.exports = {\n",
    "  content: ['*.html'],\n",
    "  theme: {\n",
    "    extend: {\n",
    "      screens: {\n",
    "        'xxsm': '256px', // for a pre 2000 screen\n",
    "        'xsm': '416px',  // for a more reasonable size\n",
    "      },\n",
    "    }\n",
    "  },\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Then I had to make sure that everything wouldn't get too small by settings a min width to the `body` with `min-w-40`. Then I had to make sure that everything wouldn't get too big with `w-full max-w-screen-sm mx-auto` on the main div. Then I had to... nope that's all.\n",
    "\n",
    "To collapse the names field when there isn't enough room, I use this little grid pattern :\n",
    "```html\n",
    "<div class=\"grid grid-cols-1 xsm:grid-cols-2 gap-4\">\n",
    "<!-- The grid has one column on small size, and 2 otherwise. Notice I can use my custom breakpoint without issue-->\n",
    "    <div class=\"inline-block w-full\"> \n",
    "    <!-- w-full to take the full size of the column-->\n",
    "        ...\n",
    "    </div>\n",
    "    <div class=\"inline-block w-full\">\n",
    "        ...\n",
    "    </div>\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Also remember that input field can have Regex pattern. Our email field, for example, uses one `pattern=\"^.+@.+\\..+$\"` that tells it to only accept email of form \"something\"@\"something\".\"something\". That should prevent a few typo/random input.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Full static code\n",
