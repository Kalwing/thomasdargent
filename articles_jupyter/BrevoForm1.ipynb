    "# A Simpler Newsletter Form : Creating New Contacts with Brevo.\n",
    "|A Guide to Using Their API with Django|\n",
    "\n",
    "## Wrestling with an outdated documentation\n",
    "\n",
    "Brevo is an easy-to-use newsletter service that offers a lot of great features. There's a free plan, pre-made templates, you can use SMS, Mail... and â€“ more importantly â€“ they have a nice API. But there's a dark spot on the map. Brevo hide something. Brevo wasn't always Brevo. Brevo swept its infancy under a rug... you see, before 2023, Brevo was... SendInBlue. Ok, jokes aside, it means that their otherwise impressive API documentation refers to an outdated SDK.\n",
    "\n",
    "For a project, I had to implement a newsletter form so that users could join a mailing list. To better integrate it to the website, we wanted to use a custom form. Simple enough. Except the contacts' documentation refer to a SendInBlue python SDK, and the package is **complicated**. I wanted to reverse engineer the SDK but it is huge, it isn't easy to make your way through the code. Lazily, I decided to use the requests library to interact with the Brevo API directly. This tutorial describes the process.\n",
    "\n",
    "### A fake problem because of an inconsistency\n",
    "\n",
    "While writing this I realized that the [github documentation](https://github.com/getbrevo/brevo-python/blob/main/docs/ContactsApi.md#add_contact_to_list)  of the Brevo package, linked on the new SDK page, is up-to-date. As I said, that is not the case of the [API documentation of their website](https://developers.brevo.com/reference/createcontact), which refers to a SendInBlue GitHub profile. Nevermind, let's just say this article might help people that were as lost as me find their way between both !\n",
    "\n",
    "## What to expect in this series\n",
    "This first part will only focus on making your API with. The next one will describe the front end implementation with HTMX, as a bonus. Finally I will write an article on how you can add a custom captcha to the form (or any form, for that matter). \n",

    "You can send your contacts as such, but you usually want them in a list, to have a better control on who you send your newsletter to. As such, you need to add a field to the dict containing a list of `int` (you can send the contact to multiple lists as one). The list Id can be found on the main Brevo website after a `#`. Sorry for the french interface, here the listId is 2 (which seems to be the default starting Id).\n",

    "To send contacts to Brevo, they need to make sure we are the right person, otherwise anyone could spam our contact list. To do that, it gives use a secret key, called the API key.
