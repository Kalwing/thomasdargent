		description: `In 2021 I did my final Master's internship at the CREATIS lab. I focused on studying cardiac function, specifically of the right ventricle. The heart, a complex four-chamber organ, plays a vital role in pumping blood between the lungs and the body. However, assessing the right ventricle is challenging due to its intricate shape. Long overlooked in clinical research, the study of the right ventricle has proven essential for certain pathologies.
<br/><br/>
Right ventricular dysfunction — caused by high pressure, excess volume, or heart disease — remains difficult to evaluate with traditional imaging methods like echocardiography and MRI, which provide only measurements for large surfaces and lack local precision. Here, myocardial strain analysis offers a solution by quantifying local deformation and pinpointing problematic areas more accurately. My work involved comparing different strain calculation techniques to better adapt these measurements to the unique characteristics of the right ventricle.
<br/><br/>
This research aims to refine diagnostic tools and provide physicians with more precise, localized metrics, ultimately helping to improve patient care for those with cardiac conditions.
